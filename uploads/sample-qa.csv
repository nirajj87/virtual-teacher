"What is Laravel Dependency Injection?","Dependency Injection is a way to give objects or services their dependencies automatically. In Laravel I use it mostly in constructors or methods which makes the code cleaner testable and easy to manage.","Laravel"
"What are Migrations?","Migrations are like version control for the database. They allow me to define the structure of the database in code and make changes using commands which is much safer than doing it manually in SQL.","Laravel"
"What is Primary Key?","A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It doesn't allow null or duplicate values. I always make sure every table has a primary key for better performance and data integrity.","SQL"

"What is your understanding about Composite Key?","A composite key is a primary key made using two or more columns. I use it when one column alone can't uniquely identify a record.","SQL"
"What is Cluster Index?","A clustered index sorts the actual data in the table physically. Since there can only be one way to sort each table can have only one clustered index.","SQL"

"How to create a primary key if the table has duplicate values?","First I remove duplicate values from the column using SQL queries. Then I can safely set that column as a primary key using ALTER TABLE command.","SQL"
"Performance of query after indexing.?","After indexing query performance improves a lot because indexes allow the database to find rows faster without scanning the entire table.","SQL"

"What is service provider and service manager?","In Laravel a Service Provider registers classes or bindings into the Service Container (service manager). I use it to bind custom services so they can be injected easily throughout the app.","Laravel"
"Create Singleton class.?","A singleton class allows only one object. I define a private constructor and use a static method to create or return the instance. It's good for shared resources like DB connections.","Laravel"
"How to connect multiple databases?","I define multiple connections in config/database.php and then use DB::connection('name') to use the desired one. It's helpful for working with external or legacy databases.","Laravel"

"How to make custom facades?","To make a custom facade. I first create a class and bind it in the service container then create a facade class that extends Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Facade. This lets me use it like a static class.","Laravel"
"What is a facade?","A facade in Laravel is a static-like interface to a class in the service container. It makes the code clean and easy to read especially for beginners.","Laravel"
"Understanding of Traits?","Traits are a way to reuse common code in multiple classes without inheritance. I use them when I have methods that are needed in more than one class like logging or custom helpers.","Laravel"
